# Ideabox

### Summary
An interactive repository of wit and wisdom-- all customizable by the user!
### How it Works
- Construct a new idea, by filling out the title and body fields and pressing the "Save" button.
- A new Idea card will be created and deployed which the user can favorite, by pressing the star icon, or delete by pressing
the close button, at will.
- The user may toggle between viewing all ideas freely, or only those which have been favorited by pressing the corresponding button in the left-hand column.
- Ideas are saved into local storage and will persist upon page reload for user convenience.
- The user may search the list of ideas, for content in the title OR body and only the relevant idea cards will display. Clearing the search bar, returns the user to the full view.
### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

### Future Additions
-Smoother repopulation of ideas as keys are erased on the search bar.
